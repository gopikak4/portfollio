     I’m a passionate front-end developer based in Coimbatore, with a keen eye for detail and a love for creating seamless user experiences. My expertise lies in building responsive, dynamic websites and web applications using the latest technologies. With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I strive to deliver clean, efficient, and maintainable code.
    
     I enjoy collaborating with designers and back-end developers to turn creative ideas into functional, user-friendly interfaces. Continuous learning is a core value of mine, and I’m always exploring new tools and frameworks to stay at the forefront of the ever-evolving web development landscape.
    
     When I’m not coding, I’m probably experimenting with new design trends, contributing to open-source projects, or diving into UX/UI principles to enhance my craft. Let’s connect and create something amazing!
